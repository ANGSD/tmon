                 jMon - A distributed resource monitor
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install:

(1) make
(2) make install

This will first compile both the daemon and client, then copy the daemon, 
jmond, to /usr/sbin and the client, jmon, to /usr/bin. Note that only root 
should be allowed to install the binaries.

Edit and copy the jmonrc file to your home directory as ~/.jmonrc which is the
default filename. Alternative filenames may be specified on the command line.
